  <h2 style="border: solid 5px green; width: 150px; ">History of IT</h2>
   <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;"> In a modern context, the term ‘IT’ is commonly used to describe computers and networks within a business environment. It refers to their applications in: generating, manipulating, storing, regaining, transmitting, handling, exchanging, studying and securing all data or information in an electronic format. IT is also used as an umbrella term to cover: television, telecommunication equipment, software, e-commerce and the internet.

    When thinking about IT you need to consider IT support within both your personal and private life. Especially when it comes to the increasingly sophisticated level of cyber crime we see every day. This is so that when you are surfing the web on your computer or receiving an email, your personal and business data is kept safe. IT support also covers technical problems you may come across, ensuing you are using the most up to date software and finding the best tools possible to effectively complete tasks.
    
    Humanity has been manipulating, storing, and communicating information since the early Sumerians pioneered the written word in ancient Mesopotamia, circa 3000 BC. The term IT did not appear until the mid-20th century however when an influx of early office technology appeared. The term was first published in the 1958 Harvard Business Review when authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas C. Whisler said “the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it Information Technology.”</p>
